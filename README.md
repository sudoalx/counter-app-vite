# Counter App with Vite + React

This is a simple counter app built with Vite and React. This app was built as a part of my internship, nothing special here. I wrote comments in the code to help me understand what I was doing but I wrote them in English and Spanish Idk why.  

This was part of a larger private repository but I decided to separate it because the repository was getting too big. I didn't preserve the git history because I don't think it's that useful for this small project anyway.  

## Installation

Clone the repository and run `yarn install` to install the dependencies.
